# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn (whether a customer will stop using a service) using machine learning techniques. The project leverages a dataset from Kaggle and utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data processing, visualization, and modeling.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for many industries, as it directly impacts revenue. By predicting churn, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve their services. This project involves:

* Data Loading and Exploration: Importing the dataset and understanding its structure.

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning.

* Feature Engineering: Transforming categorical features into numerical ones.

* Model Training and Evaluation: Building a predictive model and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset. It contains information about customers, such as demographic details, services used, and account information. The target variable is Churn, which indicates whether a customer has churned (Yes or No).

Key Features:

* CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer.

* Gender: Customer's gender.

* SeniorCitizen: Indicates if the customer is a senior citizen (1 or 0).

* Tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company.

* MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer monthly.

* Churn: Target variable (Yes or No).

## Libraries Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of XX%.

The confusion matrix and classification report provided insights into model performance.
